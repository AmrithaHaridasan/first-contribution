# Let's introduce the basic concepts of Issues and Pull Requests on Open Source Projects

## Issues
An Issue is a note on a repository about something that needs attention. It could be a bug, a feature request or a question.

## Pull Requests
When you make a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone merge your contribution into their souce branch. So pull requests helps to resolve issues.

**Tip** : *When submitting a pull request against an issue it is adviceable to comment on the corresponding issue regarding your pull request*

## Your Task 

- Open an Issue by creating a [New Issue](https://github.com/iiitkottayam/first-contribution/issues) in the repository. Well as of now your names in the *contributors* file do not look much formatted so you have to create an issue as *Formatting Name*

- Once you have created your *Issue* change the code as (in your cloned repository)
```
## Your Name
```
- After doing this your name will appear just like the formatting of ```<h2>``` tag.

## Next Step

- Now you may *add*, *commit* and *push* your changes.
- After this visit the *Forked version of Repository* using your Github Account.
- It will automatically ask you to create a pull request.
- Create the pull request and also comment about the pull request in the issue you created.

## You are done

- For ease of understanding an example has been done for you.
- Take as look at [issues of the Repository](https://github.com/iiitkottayam/first-contribution/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
- Take a look at [commit history](https://github.com/iiitkottayam/first-contribution/commit/41771896314a1cce550759970bdb0adc30d5e0f9)

## Wait for the merge :)
